folder-link
===========

WPF application to display aggregated content from several different folders

Imagine this scenario:
You collect movies, songs, pictures or whatever else kind of file.
You have them distributed on several locations, on several HDDs, on several PCs.
You'd like to see them together as if they were in a single folder, so that you can sort them, check if there are dupes and do
I/O operations like Opening, Renaming, Deleting, Copying, Moving, etc.

Sadly, Windows doesn't allow this kind of folder mounting, so I am trying to provide an useful tool to deal with this situation,
and provide some useful extra, like a filename similarity comparison that could suggest possible duplicates.
